### Notes

I attempted to use white witch instead of witch in the major character dispersion chart but it wouldn't work for an unknown reason, but I cannot recall the proper noun witch being used for anybody other than the white witch so it should work fine

JK Rowling has stated that the Chronicles of Narnia were her favorite books growing up. I am interested in comparing the textual similarities between Narnia and Harry Potter.

While the main characters in narnia are mentioned throughout nearly every book in the series, supporting characters do not stick around until the latter half of the books. I mention polly and digory as minor characters and do note that while they are main characters in the first book, they don't appear again until the last book.

Utilizing the data collected from an individual in 2016, it is interesting to find stark differences, such as in the theme of minor characters not sticking around in Narnia while they do in Harry Potter
